## Reducing False Arrhythmia alarms in the ICU with Naive Bayes

Reducing False Arrhythmia alarms in the ICU
This year's challenge is based on the Physionet Challenge of the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015.

The problem we want to address is the high false alarm rates in the ICU, which decrease dramatically the quality of the care by slowing the response while increasing the noise in the ICU rooms.

The data set comprises monitor signals from ICU with labeled arrhythmia alarms. Some of them are false alarms some are true alarms.

Data were collected from four hospitals in the USA and Europe and were manually annotated by two experts. Each of the N records included always two ECG channels and in some cases PPG and or ABP.

The main objective of this challenge is that you explore filters, power spectral density estimators, beat detectors, singular value decomposition, and anything that you read in the literature to detect false alarms in ICU signals.
